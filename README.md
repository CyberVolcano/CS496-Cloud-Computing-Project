### Description

This project demonstrates how real or simulated devices (e.g., sensors measuring
temperature/humidity) can send data to a central platform for real-time storage,
analytics, or dashboarding. It exposes you to event-driven architectures, message
brokering (MQTT), and how to set up dashboards for streaming data.
